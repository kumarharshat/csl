Learning under requirements with pytorch

* Documentation: https://csl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

## What is it?

**csl** (standing for *Constrained Statistical Learning*) is a Python package
based around pytorch to simplify the definition of constrained learning problems
and then solving them.

It was developed to run experiments for my [research](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~luizf)
on learning under requirements.

## Requirements

* numpy
* pytorch
* matplotlib (for plotting)


## Installation

In your working folder simply do

```bash
   $ git clone https://github.com/lchamon/csl.git
```

or [download and extract](https://github.com/lchamon/csl/archive/main.zip).
